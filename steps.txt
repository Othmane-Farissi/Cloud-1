Here are the summarized steps to achieve what is done in the `imaddine1/cloud-1` repository:

---

### 1. **Understand the Goal**
- Deploy an application using Ansible and a cloud provider (DigitalOcean).
- Build on top of the "Inception" project by adding a custom PHPMyAdmin service, using Docker containers orchestrated via Ansible.

---

### 2. **Learn Essential Ansible Concepts**
- **Inventory File:** Lists and groups the remote servers (VMs) Ansible manages. Variables (like IP, credentials) are often set here.
- **Variables:** Used throughout playbooks and roles to make automation dynamic and reusable.
- **Playbooks:** YAML files that define the tasks to be executed on the remote machines.
- **Modules & Plugins:** Built-in or custom scripts (mainly Python) that perform discrete actions (e.g., install a package).
- **Roles:** Structured, reusable units containing tasks, handlers, variables, templates, and files for a specific function or service.
- **Security:** Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive data such as credentials.

---

### 3. **Set Up Your Environment**
- Have Ansible installed on your local (control) machine.
- Set up your DigitalOcean (or other cloud) account and have API credentials ready.

---

### 4. **Prepare the Inventory**
- Create an `inventory.ini` file, grouping your VMs (e.g., `[webservers]`, `[dbservers]`) and specifying necessary variables (hostnames, IPs, SSH users, etc.).

---

### 5. **Write Playbooks**
- Create YAML playbooks specifying:
  - Which hosts/groups to target.
  - Which tasks/modules to run (e.g., install Docker, configure Nginx, deploy containers).
  - Use variables for configuration values (e.g., database passwords, admin users).

---

### 6. **Create and Use Roles**
- Initialize a new role (e.g., `ansible-galaxy init setup`).
- Populate the role’s directories:
  - `tasks/`: List of tasks to execute.
  - `vars/`, `defaults/`: Role-specific and default variables.
  - `handlers/`: For service notifications (like restarting Nginx).
  - `templates/`: Jinja2 configs, populated dynamically for each host.
  - `files/`: Static files to copy.
  - `meta/`: Role metadata and dependencies.
- Reference the role in your playbook under the `roles:` block.

---

### 7. **Secure Sensitive Data**
- Encrypt secret files (such as database credentials) using `ansible-vault encrypt <file>`.
- Optionally, configure `ansible.cfg` to automatically use your vault password.

---

### 8. **Run Your Playbook**
- Execute the automation with:
  ```
  ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
  ```

---

### 9. **Review and Maintain**
- Check the deployment and logs for errors.
- Adapt playbooks and roles as needed.
- For best practice, split roles by service (not just one role for everything).

---

### 10. **Further Learning**
- Explore more about Ansible Collections, Tower, and advanced plugins/modules as needed.

---

**Summary:**  
The key to replicating this repository’s solution is to structure your infrastructure-as-code project around Ansible’s inventory, playbooks, roles, and secure variable management, automating the deployment of Dockerized services to cloud VMs.
